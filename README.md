Proofs made simple 

**Project Title:** Secure KYC Verification through Merkle Tree Integration on XRPL

**Executive Summary:**

This project aims to enhance Know Your Customer (KYC) processes by developing an advanced solution that leverages Merkle proofs to securely manage and verify user identities on the XRP Ledger (Ripple). Our solution will focus on creating a dynamic Merkle tree structure that generates a unique Merkle root, integrating these components into Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) or an EMV sidechain. This integration will facilitate reliable identity verification and data management for wallet users upon site entry, ensuring enhanced security and user trust.

**Objective:**

Our primary objective is to design and implement a versatile KYC verification system that:
1. Processes custom webforms to capture and validate user data.
2. Constructs a comprehensive Merkle tree from the collected data, generating leaves and a secure Merkle root.
3. Integrates the generated Merkle proof with user DIDs or an EMV sidechain, attached to their digital wallets.
4. Provides a seamless and secure method for websites to verify wallet ownership and associated KYC data without compromising user privacy.

**Methodology:**

The project will be executed through the development of two main components:
1. **KYC Webform Integration:** A software solution, deployable as both an executable file and an API, will be developed to integrate custom KYC webforms seamlessly with websites. This tool will collect user data and convert it into JSON format suitable for Merkle tree construction.
2. **Merkle Tree Construction and Integration:** Utilizing the JSON data, a Merkle tree will be constructed where each leaf represents encrypted user data, culminating in a Merkle root. This root, along with the complete tree, will be integrated into the user's DID or linked via an EMV sidechain on the XRPL, providing a robust mechanism for data verification.

**Impact:**

The proposed solution will drastically improve the reliability and security of KYC processes by:
- Ensuring data integrity and non-repudiation through cryptographic proofs.
- Reducing the risk of identity theft and fraud on digital platforms.
- Enhancing user experience by minimizing the need for repeated KYC submissions across platforms.

**Conclusion:**

By implementing this innovative KYC verification system on the XRP, we aim to set a new standard for secure, efficient, and user-friendly digital identity verification. This project not only supports the growth and security of the XRP ecosystem but also aligns with the broader goal of enhancing digital trust and privacy in the blockchain domain.

# Status
At this time you can use the merkle tree to create a proof but please do not use in a live environment as there is a potential for security issues as the tool is not fully developed right now it is just a proof of concept POC. In the next few months an API and a downloadable docker version will be avaliable for use.
