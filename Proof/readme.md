# Instructions 

Currently in draft format. Instructions will be added once developed. 


# Status
At this time you can use the merkle tree to create a proof but please do not use in a live environment as there is a potential for security issues as the tool is not fully developed right now it is just a proof of concept POC. In the next few months an API and a downloadable docker version will be avaliable for use.
